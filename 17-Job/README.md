## Job:

### A Job is a Kubernetes object that runs a batch processing task to completion. It is used to execute a task that needs to be run once or a finite number of times. A Job creates one or more Pods to execute the task, and once the task is complete, the Pods are terminated.

#### Here are some key characteristics of Jobs:

- Run to completion: Jobs are designed to run a task to completion, and once the task is finished, the Job is considered complete.
- Finite execution: Jobs are executed a finite number of times, and once the task is complete, the Job is terminated.
- No scheduling: Jobs do not have a scheduling mechanism, and they are executed immediately when created.
